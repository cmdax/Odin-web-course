      <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
      <p>
        This isn't the first recipe inspired by something I saw on "Triple D,"
        and it won't be the last. But I can only give the show and the
        restaurant involved partial credit for this amazingly delicious grilled
        pork. Usually when I see something I'm interested in creating, I'll find
        the specific episode (along with the written recipe) and I generally end
        up with something pretty close. Other times, like this one, I don't do
        any research at all. I simply use whatever I remember from the show,
        plus my own instincts, and come up with something I'll generously call
        "semi-original." By the way, the restaurant that inspired this is called
        Krakatoa, named after a volcanic mountain in Indonesia. It's only going
        to take one taste to understand the thought process behind me calling
        this "volcano pork." This fairly simple marinade is going to produce an
        eruption of flavor no matter what cut of meat you use, but I absolutely
        loved it with the very user-friendly pork loin. Whether you cut you own
        (like I showed in the video) or you buy ready-to-grill boneless pork
        chops, you're in for a major treat. And yes, I will try to film and post
        the recipe for the coconut butter rice as well. In the meantime, though,
        I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless pork loin roast, trimmed</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup thinly sliced lemongrass</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 Peppers, fresno, raw</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 medium limes, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Slice the pork loin across into 1/2-inch thick pieces. Place into a
          large plastic zip-top bag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add lemongrass, ginger, Fresno chiles, serrano chile, shallot, garlic,
          turmeric, pepper, cumin, cayenne, brown sugar, lime juice, soy sauce,
          fish sauce, and oil to a blender or food processor, and blend on high
          until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour marinade into the bag of pork and massage thoroughly and toss
          until it's evenly coated. Seal the bag, squeezing out excess air as
          you do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer to the refrigerate and marinate overnight, or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat. Remove pork from bag, wiping
          off most of the excess marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted
          into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 3 to 4
          minutes per side.
        </li>
      </ol>
