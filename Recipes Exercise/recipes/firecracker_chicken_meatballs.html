    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and pressed</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank’s Red Hot® Buffalo Wing Sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees
        C). Line a large baking sheet with foil, and lightly spray with cooking
        spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir egg, jalapeño, soy sauce, onion powder, ginger, garlic, and pepper
        together in a large bowl. Add ground chicken and breadcrumbs, and gently
        mix just until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form into meatballs using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop; shape with wet
        hands. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the center, 8 to 10
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, for firecracker sauce, combine hot sauce, brown sugar, soy
        sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan over
        medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook
        for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat to
        cool. The sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each meatball into sauce or brush each meatball with sauce, return
        to the baking sheet, and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle or brush with additional sauce as desired, sprinkle with chopped
        parsley, and serve. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.
      </li>
    </ol>
